# Transmission Power Control in IEEE802.15.4 Networks using Machine Learning
This repository hosts my thesis project, centered on predicting metrics in IEEE802.15.4 networks, with the aim of minimizing energy consumption in network nodes. The goal is to predict metrics such as noise or interference in a communication channel between two nodes. The project utilizes machine learning and deep learning models such as Neural Networks and Random Forest for making accurate predictions.

# Repository Overview
- **Objective**: Predicting metrics in IEEE802.15.4 networks, using data obtained by a simulator.
- **Methodology**: Metrics prediction using machine and deep learning models. We use Neural Networks and Random Forest algorithms to predict metrics for each communication - channel established during a specific time period.
- **Data**: The dataset consists of metrics related to message exchanges between nodes.
- **Models** Used: Keras NNs, Random Forest.

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the latest version of Python installed. The required libraries are listed in the Necessary Python Libraries.txt file. You can install them using pip or conda commands.
